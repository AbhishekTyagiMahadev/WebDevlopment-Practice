# Why React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation
- Debugging and maintenance is easy

# More About React
- **JSX**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This makes the code more readable and easier to write.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React encourages building UIs using components, which are reusable and can manage their own state.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to understand and debug applications.
- **Ecosystem**: React has a rich ecosystem with a variety of libraries and tools for state management (like Redux), routing (like React Router), and more.
- **Community**: React has a large and active community, which means plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries are available.
- **Performance**: React's virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithm ensure high performance and fast updates.
- **React Native**: React can be used for mobile app development through React Native, allowing you to build cross-platform mobile apps using the same principles.

# Getting Started with React
**Installation**: You can install React using npm or yarn.
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
