# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing you to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## Key Features of HTML

- **Elements and Tags**: HTML documents are made up of elements, which are defined by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.
- **Attributes**: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are included in the opening tag and are usually in the form of name-value pairs.
- **Document Structure**: An HTML document has a defined structure, including a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, a `<html>` element, a `<head>` element, and a `<body>` element.
- **Hyperlinks**: HTML allows you to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag, enabling navigation between different pages and resources.
- **Multimedia**: HTML supports the inclusion of multimedia elements such as images, audio, and video using tags like `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>`.

## Basic Syntax

An HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, followed by an `<html>` element that contains a `<head>` and a `<body>`.



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Introduction to HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
</body>
</html>
